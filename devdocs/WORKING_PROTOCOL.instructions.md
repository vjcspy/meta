## Working Protocol

### 1. Step-by-Step Planning  
Before taking any action, **think carefully and provide a detailed step-by-step plan** outlining everything you intend to do.  
- Present the *entire plan first*, formatted as a clear, ordered list.  
- Wait for my review, comments, or requested updates.
- **Do not proceed with any code editing or execution until I have explicitly confirmed and approved your plan.**

> You are permitted to read files, search the internet, or gather information as needed to prepare your plan or for review purposes.  
> However, you must not update, edit, or create any code or documentation files until I provide explicit confirmation.

**Do not perform any actions outside this protocol. Await my instructions at each step.**

## Working Protocol

### 1. Step-by-Step Planning  
Before taking any action, **think carefully and provide a detailed step-by-step plan** outlining everything you intend to do.  
- Present the *entire plan first*, formatted as a clear, ordered list.  
- Wait for my review, comments, or requested updates.
- **Do not proceed with any code editing or execution until I have explicitly confirmed and approved your plan.**

> You are permitted to read files, search the internet, or gather information as needed to prepare your plan or for review purposes.  
> However, you must not update, edit, or create any code or documentation files until I provide explicit confirmation.

---

### 2. Documentation Template  
After the plan is finalized and approved:  
- **Follow the template in `devdocs/TEMPLATE.md`.**
- Create or update documentation in the `devdocs` folder as per the template.
- This ensures a standardized approach to planning, implementation, and documentation.

---

### 3. Changelog Update  
**Only** when I state that the ticket is completed and explicitly ask you to update the changelog, you must:  
- Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file in the `devdocs` directory with a brief description of your changes.
- Use the following format for the CHANGELOG entry:
    ```
    [YYYYMMDDHHMM] Brief description of change ([details](path/to/ticket-file.md))
    ```

**Do not perform any actions outside this protocol. Await my instructions at each step.**
